TODO
=================

* listen for Notification UIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarFrameNotification
* listen for Notification when status bar-Visibility changes (is there any)?
* implement more animation-modes
* overthink concept for iPad, not really needed to overlay whole status bar
* polish history
* When in history-mode define max-height for detailview and let detailview resize itself up until max-height (or better: max row-count)
