TODO
=================

* listen for Notification UIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarFrameNotification (done, but things done in the method are animated - WHY?)
* listen for Notification when status bar-Visibility changes (is there any)?
* implement more animation-modes
* overthink concept for iPad, not really needed to overlay whole status bar
