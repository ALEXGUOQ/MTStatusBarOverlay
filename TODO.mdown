TODO
=================

* getting rotation on iPad to work
* listen for Notification UIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarFrameNotification
* listen for Notification when status bar-Visibility changes (is there any)?
* implement more animation-modes
* overthink concept for iPad, not really needed to overlay whole status bar
* polish history
* re-work concept: introduce message-queue for every message (not separate queueing-model), if showWithMessage is called very fast in a row animate all messages and show them for a short period of time
